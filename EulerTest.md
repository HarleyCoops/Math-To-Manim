Euler's Polyhedron Formula: V - E + F = 2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  Opening Scene: The Mystery of Counting

  Begin in darkness. A single glowing vertex appears—a luminous cyan point floating in space. Text fades in: "What do all closed shapes have in common?"

  Camera slowly pulls back to reveal a wireframe tetrahedron materializing around the point. The four vertices pulse softly in cyan (#00FFFF), edges glow in electric blue (#0080FF), and faces shimmer as translucent golden surfaces (#FFD700, 30% opacity).     

  Act 1: Counting the Tetrahedron

  Animate each element appearing one by one with satisfying "pop" sounds:
  - Vertices (V): Count 1, 2, 3, 4 as each cyan dot illuminates -> Display "V = 4"
  - Edges (E): Trace each edge with a traveling light particle, count to 6 -> Display "E = 6"
  - Faces (F): Each triangular face fills with golden light, count to 4 -> Display "F = 4"

  The equation assembles itself: 4 - 6 + 4 = 2 [OK]

  Camera orbits 360° around the tetrahedron as it slowly rotates.

  Act 2: The Cube Test

  Smooth morph transition—tetrahedron vertices stretch and reshape into a cube. New color scheme: vertices in magenta (#FF00FF), edges in purple (#8000FF), faces in soft coral (#FF6B6B, 30% opacity).

  Rapid counting animation with numbers floating next to each element:
  - V = 8 (vertices flash sequentially)
  - E = 12 (edges light up like circuits)
  - F = 6 (faces glow one by one)

  Equation: 8 - 12 + 6 = 2 [OK]

  Display both polyhedra side-by-side, spinning gently.

  Act 3: The Dodecahedron Challenge

  Camera zooms into empty space, then a complex dodecahedron assembles from scattered vertices—like magnetic particles finding their positions. Use emerald green (#50C878) for vertices, silver (#C0C0C0) for edges, deep blue (#1E3A5F, 40% opacity) for
  pentagonal faces.

  Slower, more deliberate counting:
  - V = 20 (vertices spiral inward)
  - E = 30 (edges weave together)
  - F = 12 (pentagons lock into place)

  20 - 30 + 12 = 2 [OK]

  Text appears: "No matter the shape... always 2."

  Act 4: The Proof Intuition (Visual)

  Show a sphere with a polyhedron projected onto its surface. Animate "popping" one face open—the polyhedron flattens into a 2D planar graph like a flower blooming.

  Demonstrate visually:
  1. Start with V vertices, E edges, F faces (including outer infinite face)
  2. Remove edges one by one—each removal either merges two faces (F decreases) or disconnects nothing
  3. Triangulate remaining faces
  4. Show that V - E + F remains invariant through each operation

  Use animated arrows and color-coded tracking to follow the count.

  Act 5: Generalization—The Euler Characteristic

  Camera pulls back dramatically. Multiple shapes float in a cosmic void:
  - Sphere (χ = 2)
  - Torus/donut (χ = 0) — show the "hole" highlighted in red
  - Double torus (χ = -2) — two holes glowing

  Display the generalized formula with LaTeX:
  $$\chi = V - E + F = 2 - 2g$$

  Where g = genus (number of holes). Animate a sphere morphing into a torus, showing χ dropping from 2 to 0.

  Closing: The Topological Invariant

  All shapes arrange in a circle around the central equation. Camera rises overhead for a god's-eye view. Text: 

  "Euler's formula reveals that topology cares not about size or shape—only about connectivity and holes."

  Final shot: The number 2 glows brilliantly at center, surrounded by orbiting polyhedra.
