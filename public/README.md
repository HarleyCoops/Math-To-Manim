# Public Assets Directory

This directory previously contained a large GIF file (`Rhombicosidodecahedron.gif`, 460MB) that was removed to reduce repository size.

## What happened?

The file was removed as part of an effort to reduce the repository size and make it more contributor-friendly. Large binary files significantly increase clone times and create barriers for new contributors.

## Options for restoration:

If you need to display this animation:

1. **Regenerate the file**: Run the corresponding Manim script to regenerate the animation locally
2. **Use external hosting**: Upload to YouTube, Vimeo, or a CDN and embed in the README
3. **Create a smaller version**: Generate a lower resolution or shorter GIF for documentation purposes
4. **Link to releases**: Attach the full-quality version to a GitHub release and link to it

## Recommendation

For documentation and README purposes, consider using:
- A smaller, optimized GIF (< 5MB)
- An external video hosting service
- A thumbnail image that links to the full animation

This keeps the repository lightweight while still showcasing the project's capabilities.
