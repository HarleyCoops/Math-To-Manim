Create a Manim animation script (using Manim Community Edition) that explains the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Machine Learning.
The animation should be approximately 2 minutes long and include the following scenes:
1.  **Introduction**: Define Bias and Variance visually.
    *   Bias: Show a target (bullseye) and shots consistently missing the center but clustered together (High Bias).
    *   Variance: Show shots scattered widely around the center (High Variance).
    *   Low Bias & Low Variance: Shots hitting the center.
2.  **Model Complexity vs Error**:
    *   Draw a 2D graph with "Model Complexity" on the X-axis and "Error" on the Y-axis.
    *   Plot the "Bias^2" curve (decreasing with complexity).
    *   Plot the "Variance" curve (increasing with complexity).
    *   Plot the "Total Error" curve (sum of Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible Error).
    *   Highlight the "Optimal Complexity" point (minimum total error).
3.  **Underfitting vs Overfitting**:
    *   Show a simple dataset (points with some noise following a curve).
    *   Fit a straight line (Underfitting/High Bias).
    *   Fit a highly wiggly polynomial passing through every point (Overfitting/High Variance).
    *   Fit a smooth curve that captures the trend (Optimal).
4.  **Conclusion**: Summarize the tradeoff.

Use clear colors (e.g., BLUE for Bias, RED for Variance, GREEN for Total Error).
Ensure the code is complete, runnable, and uses `Scene` or `MovingCameraScene`.
Add voiceover text as comments in the code.
