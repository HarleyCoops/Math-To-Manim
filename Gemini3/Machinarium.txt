Create a Manim animation script (using Manim Community Edition) that explains Regularization (L1, L2, Elastic Net) in Machine Learning.
The animation should be approximately 2 minutes long and include the following scenes:

1.  **The Problem: Unconstrained Optimization**:
    *   Show a 3D contour plot representing a Loss Function (like a valley).
    *   Show a "ball" (the parameters) rolling down to the absolute minimum (Global Minimum).
    *   Explain that for complex models, this minimum often corresponds to Overfitting (large weights).

2.  **The Solution: Adding a Penalty**:
    *   Show the Loss Equation: $J(\theta) = \text{MSE} + \lambda \cdot \text{Penalty}$.
    *   Explain that $\lambda$ controls the strength of the penalty.

3.  **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**:
    *   Visualise the penalty as a **Circle** (Constraint Region) centered at the origin.
    *   Show the optimization trying to minimize the Loss while staying near the circle.
    *   Result: Weights are shrunk towards zero but rarely hit exactly zero.

4.  **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**:
    *   Visualise the penalty as a **Diamond** (Constraint Region).
    *   Show that the Loss contours often hit the "corners" of the diamond first.
    *   Result: Some weights become exactly zero (Feature Selection/Sparsity).

5.  **Elastic Net**:
    *   Show a shape that is a mix of Diamond and Circle (convex but with corners).
    *   Explain it combines the benefits of both (grouping effect + sparsity).

6.  **Conclusion**: Summary table.
    *   L2: Good for collinearity, keeps all features.
    *   L1: Good for sparse data, selects features.
    *   Elastic Net: Best of both worlds.

Use clear colors:
*   LOSS CONTOURS: Blue
*   CONSTRAINT REGION (L1/L2): Red/Orange
*   OPTIMAL POINT: Green Dot

Ensure the code is complete, runnable, and uses `ThreeDScene`. Add voiceover text as comments.
