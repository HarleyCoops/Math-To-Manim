Create a Manim animation script (using Manim Community Edition) that explains Cross-Validation Strategies in Machine Learning.
The animation should be approximately 2 minutes long and include the following scenes:

1.  **The Problem with a Single Split**:
    *   Show a dataset.
    *   Split it into Train (80%) and Test (20%).
    *   Show that if the "Test" set happens to be easy or hard by random chance, our evaluation is unreliable (High Variance in evaluation).

2.  **K-Fold Cross-Validation (The Gold Standard)**:
    *   Visualise the dataset as a horizontal bar.
    *   Divide it into K=5 equal folds.
    *   Animate the 5 iterations:
        *   Iteration 1: Fold 1 is Validation (Color A), Folds 2-5 are Train (Color B).
        *   Iteration 2: Fold 2 is Validation, others are Train.
        *   ... and so on.
    *   Show the "Average Performance" being calculated from the 5 scores.

3.  **Stratified K-Fold (For Imbalanced Data)**:
    *   Show a dataset with two classes: Class A (90%, Blue dots) and Class B (10%, Red dots).
    *   Show a bad random split where one fold gets zero Red dots.
    *   Demonstrate Stratified Split: Each fold maintains the 9:1 ratio.

4.  **Time Series Split (Forward Chaining)**:
    *   Show data ordered by time (left to right).
    *   Demonstrate that we cannot use future data to train for the past.
    *   Animate the expanding window:
        *   Train: [1], Test: [2]
        *   Train: [1, 2], Test: [3]
        *   Train: [1, 2, 3], Test: [4]

5.  **Conclusion**: Summary of when to use which (K-Fold for general, Stratified for classification, Time Series for temporal data).

Use clear colors:
*   TRAIN SET: Blue
*   VALIDATION/TEST SET: Orange/Red
*   DATA POINTS: White/Gray

Ensure the code is complete, runnable, and uses `Scene`. Add voiceover text as comments.
